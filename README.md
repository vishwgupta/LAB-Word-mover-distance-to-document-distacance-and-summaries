# LAB-Word-mover-distance-to-document-distacance-and-summaries

1. Build and evaluate Word2Vec Models using different Text corpora.
2. Use the best model to implement Word Mover Distance.
3. Optimize the Word Mover Distance using three techniques
proposed by Kusner et al.
  a. Word Centroid Distance
  b. Relaxed Word Mover Distance  
  c. Prefetch and Prune
4. Use Word Mover Distance to explore different heuristics
to generate summaries.

Note:
First we need to build the word2vec model to generate word vectors. These are used to generate document distances and summaries.
